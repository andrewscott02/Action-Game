  abstract={Agent modelling involves considering how other agents will behave, in order to influence your own actions. In this paper, we explore the use of agent modelling in the hidden-information, collaborative card game Hanabi. We implement a number of rule-based agents, both from the literature and of our own devising, in addition to an Information Set-Monte Carlo Tree Search (IS-MCTS) agent. We observe poor results from IS-MCTS, so construct a new, predictor version that uses a model of the agents with which it is paired. We observe a significant improvement in game-playing strength from this agent in comparison to IS-MCTS, resulting from its consideration of what the other agents in a game would do. In addition, we create a flawed rule-based agent to highlight the predictor's capabilities with such an agent.},

abstract = {Human-AI interaction is pervasive across many areas of our day to day lives. In this paper, we investigate human-AI collaboration in the context of a collaborative AI-driven word association game with partially observable information. In our experiments, we test various dimensions of subjective social perceptions (rapport, intelligence, creativity and likeability) of participants towards their partners when participants believe they are playing with an AI or with a human. We also test subjective social perceptions of participants towards their partners when participants are presented with a variety of confidence levels. We ran a large scale study on Mechanical Turk (n=164) of this collaborative game. Our results show that when participants believe their partners were human, they found their partners to be more likeable, intelligent, creative and having more rapport and use more positive words to describe their partner's attributes than when they believed they were interacting with an AI partner. We also found no differences in game outcome including win rate and turns to completion. Drawing on both quantitative and qualitative findings, we discuss AI agent transparency, include design implications for tools incorporating or supporting human-AI collaboration, and lay out directions for future research. Our findings lead to implications for other forms of human-AI interaction and communication.},

abstract = {In everyday life, people make use of theory of mind by explicitly attributing unobservable mental content such as beliefs, desires, and intentions to others. Humans are known to be able to use this ability recursively. That is, they engage in higher-order theory of mind, and consider what others believe about their own beliefs. In this paper, we use agent-based computational models to investigate the evolution of higher-order theory of mind. We consider higher-order theory of mind across four different competitive games, including repeated single-shot and repeated extensive form games, and determine the advantage of higher-order theory of mind agents over their lower-order theory of mind opponents. Across these four games, we find a common pattern in which first-order and second-order theory of mind agents clearly outperform opponents that are more limited in their ability to make use of theory of mind, while the advantage for deeper recursion to third-order theory of mind is limited in comparison.}}

abstract = {Many contemporary games are team-based and there is a growing interest in, and need for, advances in team-mate AI for games. However, although there have been surveys of agent AI in games, to date there has been no survey of work on team-mate AI. Furthermore, the concept of "team-mate AI" is not currently well delineated to distinguish between work on independently-acting agents that happen to be on the same side from work on agents the coordinate their behaviors and decision-making in terms of their teammates behaviors, intentions, and the like. Also, it is important to distinguish between game AI that is used as an optimization technique from real-time game AI, so this paper proposes a definition for real-time team-mate AI (highlighted with examples by game genre), reviews work to date to implement real-time team-mate AI for games in terms of a number of AI research areas (e.g., coordinated action, prediction, learning), and concludes with a brief discussion of significant issues about the state of the art.},
